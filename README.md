## 1. Pull and Merge difference

- Make example of pull request and two branch merge event.

### Push,Pull,Merge,Fetch

#### Basics of fetch

- The "**git fetch**" **command** is used to pull the updates from remote-tracking branches. Additionally, we can get the updates that have been pushed to our remote branches to our local machines.
- We can fetch a specific branch from a repository - `git fetch url b-name`
    
    ```
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project$ git fetch origin master
    remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
    remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 720 bytes | 720.00 KiB/s, done.
    From https://github.com/abhishek-simform-v1/project1
     * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
       6a294eb..e192d41  master     -> origin/master
    ```
    
- Then merge, `git merge`
    
    ```
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project$ git merge origin/master
    Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.
     hotel.txt | 1 +
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
     create mode 100644 hotel.txt
    ```
    
- Fetch all the branches and objects - `git fetch`
    
    ```
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project$ git fetch
    remote: Enumerating objects: 12, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (12/12), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
    remote: Total 8 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (8/8), 1.93 KiB | 657.00 KiB/s, done.
   From https://github.com/abhishek-simform-v1/project1
       e192d41..b6e8075  master     -> origin/master
       36b1ee2..d4bdccc  feature1   -> origin/feature1
       45c1c65..86aac13  newb       -> origin/newb
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project$ git merge
    Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.
     hotel.txt | 2 +-
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project$ ls
    def.txt  git-practice  hotel.txt  name.txt  text.txt
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project$ cat hotel.txt
    Real Preparika
    ```
    

### Basics of Pull

- Pull request is a process for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature. Once their feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request via their remote server account.
- Pull request announces all the team members that they need to review the code and merge it into the master branch.
    
    ![https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/git/images/git-pull.png](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/git/images/git-pull.png)
    
- We can pull a remote repository by just using the git pull command - `git pull`
    
    ```
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project$ git pull
    remote: Enumerating objects: 10, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (10/10), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
    remote: Total 6 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (6/6), 1.24 KiB | 422.00 KiB/s, done.
    From https://github.com/abhishek-simform-v1/project1
       d4bdccc..46c6a02  feature1   -> origin/feature1
       86aac13..52785fc  newb       -> origin/newb
    There is no tracking information for the current branch.
    ```
    
- For specified branch - `git pull url <b-name>`

### Basics of push

- Push local repo to remote - `git push origin <b-name>`
- Upstream remote - `git push -u origin <b-name>`

<aside>
üí° git pull = git fetch + git merge

</aside>

| git fetch | git pull |
| --- | --- |
| Fetch downloads only new data from a remote repository. | Pull is used to update your current HEAD branch with the latest changes from the remote server. |
| Fetch is used to get a new view of all the things that happened in a remote repository. | Pull downloads new data and directly integrates it into your current working copy files. |
| Fetch never manipulates or spoils data. | Pull downloads the data and integrates it with the current working file. |
| It protects your code from merge conflict. | In git pull, there are more chances to create the merge conflict. |
| It is better to use git fetch command with git merge command on a pulled repository. | It is not an excellent choice to use git pull if you already pulled any repository. |

### Some extra:

- Check the configuration of the remote server - `git remote -v`
- Add a remote for the repository - `git remote add <url>`
- Remove a remote connection from the repository - `git remote rm`
- Change remote url - `git remote set-url <url>`

## Merge

### Basics of merge

- There are two branches **master** and **feature.**
- We can see that we made some commits in both functionality and master branch, and merge them. It works as a pointer.
- It will find a common base commit between branches. Once Git finds a shared base commit, it will create a new "merge commit." It combines the changes of each queued merge commit sequence.
- To merge the specified commit to currently active branch - `git merge <commit-id>`
- To merge the specified branch to currently active branch - `git merge <branch-name>`
- **Fast Forward merge:** When f1 and f2 branch have same base point, then create 4 new file in f1 and do 4 commit for individual file created. then checkout f2 branch. f1,f2 ‚Üí c1‚Üêc2‚Üêc3‚Üêc4  (head‚Üíf1).
- Apply `git merge f1` , So it will not created new commit and do fast forward merge so now f1 and f2 points at same base point of c4 commit.
    
    ```
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/notes$ git merge f1
    Updating 208ceb8..e972ef1
    Fast-forward
     file1 | 0
     file2 | 0
     file3 | 0
     file4 | 0
     4 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
     create mode 100644 file1
     create mode 100644 file2
     create mode 100644 file3
     create mode 100644 file4
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/notes$ git diff f1 f2
    ```
    
- To prevent fast forward merge then use `‚Äîno-ff`
- It‚Äôs prevent ff and create new commit like ‚Äúmerge f1 and f2‚Äù


## 2. Rebase

- Try to rebase feature branch with master branch 

### Rebase

#### Basics

- **Rebasing** is a process to reapply commits on top of another base trip. It is used to apply a sequence of commits from distinct branches into a final commit.
- It is an alternative of git merge command. It is a linear process of merging.
- Like, Do c1 and c2 commit on f3 then, Created new branch f4 and checkout same. then commit f1 and f2 on that bracnh.
- Move to f3 branch and do c3 and c4 commit.
- Then move to f4 branch and do rebase - `git rebase <branch-name>`
    
    ```
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/notes$ git checkout f3
    Switched to branch 'f3'
    
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/notes$ touch file.txt
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/notes$ git add file.txt
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/notes$ git commit -m **"c1"**

- If there are some conflicts in the branch, resolve them, and perform below commands to continue changes -
    
    `git status`
    
    `git rebase ‚Äîcontinue`
    
- The above command is used to continue with the changes you made. If you want to skip the change, you can skip as follows -
    
    `git rebase ‚Äîskip`

## 3. Change commit message

- Commit push on commit in feature branch and then change commit message

### Introduction to Commit

- It is used to record the changes in the repository. It is the next command after the git add.
- Every commit contains the index data and the commit message. Every commit forms a parent-child relationship.
- Commits are the snapshots of the project.
- `git commit -m ‚Äúmessage‚Äù`
    
    ```
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/practice$ git add file6
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/practice$ git commit -m "added file6"
    [feature 48e2696] added file6
     1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
     create mode 100644 file6
    ```
    
- See all the commits `git log`
    
    ```
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/practice$ git log

    Date:   Wed Feb 15 10:26:46 2023 +0530
    
        Created 5 files
    ```
    
- When we create new file and update one file then we have to commit direct then use `git commit -a` or `git commit -am ‚Äúmessage‚Äù` Command to commit only modified file.
- New file still remain untracked.
    
    ```
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/practice$ touch file7
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/practice$ git status
    On branch feature
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    	modified:   file6
    
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    	file7
    
    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
    
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/practice$ git commit -a "file6 update"
    fatal: paths 'file6 update ...' with -a does not make sense
    
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/practice$ git commit -am "Updated file6"

    ```
    
### To update or change last commit message use `git commit -amend`
    
    ```

## 4. cherry pick

- Pick some commits from feature branch to master branch

### Basics of Cherry-pick

- Cherry-picking in Git stands for applying some commit from one branch into another branch.
- In case you made a mistake and committed a change into the wrong branch, but do not want to merge the whole branch.
- **You can revert the commit and apply it on another branch.**
- Cherry-pick is a useful tool, but always it is not a good option. It can cause duplicate commits and some other scenarios where other merges are preferred instead of cherry-picking.
- It is a useful tool for a few situations. It is in contrast with different ways such as **merge** and **rebase** command.
- **Use**
    - Scenerio1: Accidently make a commit in a wrong branch.
    - Scenario2: Made the changes proposes by another team member.
- Like we are in branch dev and make some changes and then commit. But If we want this commit in fea branch, So used `git cherry-pick <commit-id>`
    
    ```
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project/files$ git checkout dev
    Switched to branch 'dev'
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project/files$ git log --oneline
    27b9a5b (HEAD -> dev) okayyy f6
    408155c added restore .
    ac6afc2 added restore
    ```
    
- Pick 27b9a5b (HEAD -> dev) okayyy f6, So‚Ä¶
    
    ```
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project/files$ git checkout fea
    Switched to branch 'fea'
    
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project/files$ git cherry-pick 27b9a5b
    Auto-merging files/file6
    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in files/file6
    error: could not apply 27b9a5b... okayyy f6
    
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project/files$ git add .
    abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project/files$ git commit -m "picked f6"
    [fea b214155] picked f6
     Date: Fri Feb 17 12:08:13 2023 +0530
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 10 deletions(-)
    ```
## 5. Drop commit

- Remove some commit from feature branch.
 
```jsx
abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/practice$cat file3.txt
hey there
abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/practice$ git commit -am "file 3 edited"

 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/practice$ git push origin feature

```

- Now to drop the commit we will use reset ‚Äîhard

 

```jsx
abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project/files$ git reset --hard 7c19
HEAD is now at 7c19b86 Merge remote-tracking branch 'refs/remotes/origin/feature' into feature
abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project/files$ cat file3.txt
abhishek@sf-cpu-438:~/Desktop/project/files$
```
